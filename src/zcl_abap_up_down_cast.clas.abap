* Can't use the superclass reference to get the number of seats of the
* passenger plane, because the relevent method isn't declared in the superclass.


* plane->get_seats( ).


* Can't assign the plane directly to a passenger plane reference variable, because
* not every plane is a passenger plane.

* Make sure the plane is actually a passenger plane, then force the cast.
